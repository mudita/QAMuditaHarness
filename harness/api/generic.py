'''
GenericResponse based classes provide wrapper to get data via parameter i.e.
FsInitResponse provides us with:
    FsInitResponse.rxID
Which then is used in transfer.

GenericTransaction based class provides us with whole transaction of single Request->Response
and can be executed with harness provided.

Please see developer mode example:
    PhoneModeLock(False).run(harness)

    used for parsing
